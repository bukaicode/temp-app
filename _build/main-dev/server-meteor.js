* • [   server-entry.js ] ──▶ [   server-rspack.js ] ──▶ [■ server-meteor.js ]
*
* This file overrides the corresponding `meteor.mainModule.server` entry in
* package.json. Meteor loads it at runtime, and it imports the Rspack
* bundle (`server-rspack.js`) so the application executes using the build
* produced by Rspack.
*
* ⚠️ Note: This file is autogenerated. It is not meant to be modified manually.
* These files also act as a cache: they can be safely removed and will be
* regenerated on the next build. They should be ignored in IDE suggestions
* and version control.
