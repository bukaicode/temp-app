* This file is the bundled output generated by Rspack.
* It contains all application code and assets combined into one build.
* It is not used directly, but will be imported by the Meteor main module
* file (`client-meteor.js`) so that Meteor runs the Rspack bundle.
*
* ⚠️ Note: This file is autogenerated. It is not meant to be modified manually.
* These files also act as a cache: they can be safely removed and will be
* regenerated on the next build. They should be ignored in IDE suggestions
* and version control.
