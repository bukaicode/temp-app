* This file is the starting point for the Rspack test build. It imports your
* Meteor app's test modules so Rspack can resolve every dependency and
* generate the bundled output: `test-rspack.js`.
*
* ⚠️ Note: This file is autogenerated. It is not meant to be modified manually.
* These files also act as a cache: they can be safely removed and will be
* regenerated on the next build. They should be ignored in IDE suggestions
* and version control.
